1. Upload files through an intuitive interface
2. Analyze file content using a local LLM
3. Generate organization suggestions based on file content
4. Preview suggested organization before saving
5. Support hierarchical folder structures
6. Store file metadata and organization structure in PostgreSQL
7. Implement RAG for improved context understanding
8. Run all components locally without cloud dependencies

### Technical Requirements
1. React frontend with responsive design
2. Node.js backend with Express
3. PostgreSQL database for metadata and structure
4. Local LLM integration (llama.cpp, Ollama, or similar)
5. Vector database for RAG implementation
6. File processing capabilities for various formats
7. Docker containerization for easy deployment
