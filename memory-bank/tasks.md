## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
- [x] Initialize project repositories and structure
- [x] Set up frontend and backend
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL schema and migrations
- [x] Define API endpoints

### Phase 2: File Upload and Storage
- [x] Implement file upload and storage
- [x] Design folder structure data model
- [x] Implement basic file organization without AI

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
- [x] Implement LLM-powered organization suggestions (single, batch, folder-level)
- [x] Implement context-aware suggestions using existing folders/tags
- [x] Error handling for CORS, validation, foreign key, React rendering
- [x] Responsive, modern UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Integrate real file content for LLM analysis

### Phase 4: RAG Implementation
- [ ] Set up vector database and document embeddings
- [ ] Implement retrieval system for context enhancement
- [ ] Integrate with LLM for improved organization

### Phase 5: User Interface
- [x] Design and implement file upload interface
- [x] Create organization preview component
- [x] Implement folder navigation
- [x] Add drag-and-drop/move functionality
- [x] Implement file tagging and metadata editing UI
- [x] Implement advanced search/filtering UI

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Performance and usability testing
- [ ] Refinement of organization algorithms
- [ ] System optimization

## Next Steps
- Integrate real file content for LLM analysis
- Further batch/folder-level organization UI
- More UI/UX polish and feedback
- Option to delete files from disk on backend
- Dockerization for local deployment

## Challenges and Considerations
- Performance of local LLM on various hardware configurations
- File type support and content extraction methods
- Balancing automation with user control
- Storage management for large files
- Security considerations for file access
- Handling edge cases in file organization suggestions
- Managing system resources efficiently
- Ensuring user data privacy with local processing
