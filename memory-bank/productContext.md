# Product Context

## Product Vision
Create an intelligent file organization system that automatically categorizes files based on their content using a local LLM, making it easy for users to maintain a structured and meaningful file system without manual effort.

## Target Users
- Knowledge workers who manage many documents
- Researchers collecting various file types
- Individual users with growing personal file collections
- Small teams with shared file repositories
- Content creators managing media assets

## User Stories

### Core User Stories
1. As a user, I want to upload files and have the system suggest appropriate organization, so I can save time organizing manually.
2. As a user, I want to preview where files will be stored before confirming, so I can ensure proper organization.
3. As a user, I want to navigate a hierarchical folder structure, so I can easily find my files later.
4. As a user, I want the system to understand the context of my files, so similar content is grouped together.
5. As a user, I want all processing to happen locally, so my data remains private and secure.

### Extended User Stories
1. As a user, I want to search for files based on content, not just filenames, so I can find information quickly.
2. As a user, I want to customize organization rules, so I can adapt the system to my workflow.
3. As a user, I want to view file previews within the application, so I don't need to open files to identify them.
4. As a user, I want batch processing capabilities, so I can organize multiple files at once.
5. As a user, I want to extract metadata from files, so I can use it for better organization and searching.

## Key Product Metrics
- Upload to organization suggestion time
- Organization accuracy (user acceptance rate of suggestions)
- System resource usage (memory, CPU, disk)
- Time saved compared to manual organization
- User engagement with the organization system

## Competitive Analysis
- Traditional file explorers (Windows Explorer, macOS Finder): Limited intelligence, manual organization
- Cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox): Some AI features but require cloud storage
- Enterprise document management systems: Complex, expensive, often cloud-based
- Note-taking apps with file organization (Notion, Evernote): Limited file type support, often cloud-based

## Differentiation
- Fully local processing without data leaving the user's system
- Advanced AI capabilities without requiring cloud infrastructure
- Focus on content-based organization rather than just metadata
- Preview-before-commit approach to maintain user control
- Open architecture allowing for community extensions
