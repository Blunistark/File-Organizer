# Active Context - File Organizer System

## Current Phase
- Implementation Phase - Level 4 (Complex System)

## Active Goals
- Integrate local LLM for content analysis and organization suggestions
- Prepare Docker configuration for local deployment
- Implement dashboard and advanced features

## Current Focus
- Core infrastructure: **Complete**
- File tagging (UI and backend): **Complete**
- File metadata editing: **Complete**
- Advanced search/filtering: **Complete**
- UI is responsive and uses Material UI components

## Key Decisions Made
- Worker pool with plugin architecture for file content analysis
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for organization suggestions
- Hybrid approach for folder navigation UI
- Server-Sent Events with polling fallback for real-time updates
- Ollama for development and llama.cpp for production
- Chroma DB initially with migration path to Qdrant
- React with Material UI for frontend
- Node.js with Express for backend

## Key Decisions Pending
- Implementation roadmap and timeline
- Development environment setup details
- Testing strategy and framework selection
- Performance benchmarking approach

## Immediate Next Steps
- Begin LLM integration for content analysis and organization suggestions
- Prepare Docker configuration for local deployment
- Implement dashboard with file statistics
- Add file deduplication and backup support

## Notes
- UI is built with Material UI and is responsive
- Backend is Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL and Prisma
- All core CRUD and navigation features are functional
- LLM and RAG features are not yet started

## Next Steps
- Finalize implementation roadmap with milestones
- Set up development environment
- Initialize repositories (frontend, backend)
- Begin implementation of core infrastructure
- Create Docker Compose configuration

## Recent Changes
- Completed detailed implementation plan in tasks.md
- Created architecture design document
- Defined database schema with PostgreSQL
- Developed comprehensive API specifications
- Designed UI/UX components and user flows
- Documented LLM integration approach and pipeline
- Explored design options for complex components
- Selected technologies for implementation
