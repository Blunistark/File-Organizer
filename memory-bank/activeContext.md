# Active Context - File Organizer System

## Current Phase
- Implementation Phase - Level 4 (Complex System)

## Active Goals
- Integrate real file content for LLM analysis
- Further batch/folder-level organization UI
- More UI/UX polish and feedback
- Option to delete files from disk on backend
- Dockerization for local deployment

## Current Focus
- All core file/folder CRUD, navigation, and recursive deletion: **Complete**
- File upload, listing, download, deletion, moving, and preview (image, text, PDF): **Complete**
- File tagging, metadata editing, and advanced search/filtering: **Complete**
- LLM-powered organization suggestions (single, batch, folder-level): **Complete**
- Context-aware suggestions using existing folders/tags: **Complete**
- Responsive, modern UI/UX with Material UI, snackbars, tooltips, dialogs: **Complete**
- Error handling for CORS, validation, foreign key, and React rendering: **Complete**
- Folder suggestion Accept/Modify creates folder if missing: **Complete**

## Key Decisions Made
- Worker pool with plugin architecture for file content analysis
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for organization suggestions
- Hybrid approach for folder navigation UI
- Server-Sent Events with polling fallback for real-time updates
- Ollama for development and llama.cpp for production
- Chroma DB initially with migration path to Qdrant
- React with Material UI for frontend
- Node.js with Express for backend

## Key Decisions Pending
- Implementation roadmap and timeline
- Testing strategy and framework selection
- Performance benchmarking approach

## Immediate Next Steps
- Integrate real file content for LLM analysis
- Further batch/folder-level organization UI
- More UI/UX polish and feedback
- Option to delete files from disk on backend
- Dockerization for local deployment

## Notes
