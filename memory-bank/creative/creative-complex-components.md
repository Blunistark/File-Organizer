    Server-->>Client: Upload complete, job ID
    Note over Analysis: File processing starts
    loop Every 2 seconds
        Client->>Server: Check status (job ID)
        Server->>Analysis: Get job status
        Analysis-->>Server: Current status
        Server-->>Client: Status update
    end
    Analysis->>Server: Processing complete
    Client->>Server: Final status check
    Server-->>Client: Complete, with results
```

    Client->>Server: Establish WebSocket connection
    Server-->>Client: Connection established
    Client->>Server: Upload file
    Server-->>Client: Upload complete, job ID
    Note over Analysis: File processing starts
    Analysis->>Server: Status: 10% complete
    Server->>Client: Status: 10% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Status: 30% complete
    Server->>Client: Status: 30% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Status: 70% complete
    Server->>Client: Status: 70% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Status: Complete
    Server->>Client: Status: Complete with results
    Client->>Server: Close WebSocket
```

**Pros:**

### Design Option 3: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Analysis
    
    Client->>Server: Upload file
    Server-->>Client: Upload complete, job ID
    Client->>Server: Establish SSE connection (job ID)
    Server-->>Client: SSE stream opened
    Note over Analysis: File processing starts
    Analysis->>Server: Status changed: 10%
    Server->>Client: Event: 10% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Status changed: 35%
    Server->>Client: Event: 35% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Status changed: 75%
    Server->>Client: Event: 75% complete
    Analysis->>Server: Processing complete
    Server->>Client: Event: Complete with results
    Client->>Server: Close SSE connection
```

**Pros:**
- Real-time updates like WebSockets
- Simpler server implementation than WebSockets
- Better browser support
- Automatic reconnection
- Works with standard HTTP
- One-way communication fits this use case

**Cons:**
- Limited to text-based messages
- Less efficient than WebSockets for bi-directional communication
- Some proxies may buffer responses
- Not as widely supported as polling
- Maximum number of concurrent connections

### Recommended Approach: Server-Sent Events with Polling Fallback

Server-Sent Events provides the best balance between real-time updates and implementation simplicity for this use case. Adding polling as a fallback ensures compatibility across all environments.

- SSE is well-suited for server-to-client updates
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Works over standard HTTP
- Simpler than WebSockets for this specific need
- Polling fallback ensures universal compatibility

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Implement an event emitter on the server for analysis status updates
2. Create an SSE endpoint for clients to connect to (/analysis/{job_id}/events)
3. Implement a polling endpoint as fallback (/analysis/{job_id})
4. Design the client to try SSE first, then fall back to polling if needed
5. Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff
6. Implement a message format that includes progress percentage, stage, and status
7. Add UI components that visualize the progress (progress bar, status messages)
8. Handle connection termination gracefully on both sides
